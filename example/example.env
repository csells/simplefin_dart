# SIMPLEFIN_ACCESS_URL
# ---------------------
# Long-lived URL returned after exchanging a setup token. It includes embedded
# HTTP basic auth credentials and should be kept secret. Generate this value by:
#   1. Visiting https://beta-bridge.simplefin.org/auth/login and signing in.
#   2. Navigating to https://bridge.simplefin.org/simplefin/create to obtain a
#      setup token (Base64 string).
#   3. Running `dart run example/main.dart` with the setup token configured
#      below to print the resulting access URL.
#
# After you have the access URL, paste it on the line below (no quotes).
SIMPLEFIN_ACCESS_URL=

# SIMPLEFIN_SETUP_TOKEN
# ---------------------
# One-time token copied from https://bridge.simplefin.org/simplefin/create.
# Use this to mint a new access URL. Once exchanged successfully the token
# becomes invalid; you can leave this blank unless you need to claim a fresh
# access URL.
