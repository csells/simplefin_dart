# SIMPLEFIN_ACCESS_URL
# ---------------------
# Long-lived URL returned after exchanging a setup token. Keep it secret—it
# embeds HTTP basic auth credentials.
#
# How to generate an access URL:
#   1. Sign in at https://beta-bridge.simplefin.org/auth/login.
#   2. Visit https://bridge.simplefin.org/simplefin/create and copy the setup
#      token (Base64 string).
#   3. Run `dart run example/main.dart claim <SETUP_TOKEN>`. The command prints
#      `SIMPLEFIN_ACCESS_URL=...`; append that line to this file (for example,
#      `dart run example/main.dart claim ... >> example/.env`).
#
# Paste the access URL (no quotes) after the `=` if you prefer to edit manually.
